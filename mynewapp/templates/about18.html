        <h2>Dracula</h2>
        <p>
            This is a beautiful hardbound edition of <strong>Dracula</strong> that comes with gilded edges and elegantly designed endpapers. It is an epistolary novel, written as a collection of realistic but completely fictional diary entries, telegrams, letters, ship’s logs, and newspaper clippings—all of which add a layer of detailed realism to Stoker’s story.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the time of its publication, Dracula was considered a straightforward horror novel based on imaginary creations of supernatural life. The book is often categorized under vampire literature, horror fiction, gothic novels, and invasion literature.
        </p>

        <p>
            It explores themes like the role of women in Victorian society, sexual conventions, immigration, colonialism, and post-colonialism. Though Stoker didn’t invent the vampire, he certainly shaped its modern form through this legendary work.
